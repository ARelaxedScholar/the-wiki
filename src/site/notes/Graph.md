A graph is naught more than a collection of vertices and edges.
A vertex (sometimes called node) is one specific spot in the graph, while an edge is a connection between two nodes (may be the same node.)

From this simple defininition, it is impressive to note that almost all of the world's big problems can be approached as the solving of some kind of graph problem, one of these new problems being [[Agentic Systems\|Agentic Systems]].
